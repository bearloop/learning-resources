    "   - First line has a she-bang or hash-bang (on its own line) then the path to where Bash is\n",
    "      - #!/usr/bash\n",
    "      - that's to let the interpreter know it is a Bash scirpt and to use Bash located in /usr/bash\n",
    "      - this could be a different path if you have Bash installed somewhere else such as /bin/bash -> use \" which bash \" to check\n",
    "   - Middle of the script:\n",
    "      - It contains lines of code, such as line-by-line commands or programming constructs\n",
    "\n",
    "To save and run:\n",
    "   - Use a file extension .sh\n",
    "      - But technically if the first line has the she-bang and path to Bash (#!/usr/bash) the file extension is not needed\n",
    "   - Run by using the command \" bash script_name.sh \"\n",
    "      - If the first line is the she-bang (#!/usr/bash) you can simply run the script using \" ./script_name.sh \""
