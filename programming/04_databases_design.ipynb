    "Structuring data\n",
    " - Structured data e.g. follows a schema, has defined data types and relationships (SQL, tables in relational DBs)\n",
    " - Unstructured data are schema less and the make up most of the data in the worlds e.g. photos, chat logs, mp3\n",
    " - Semi-structured data has self-describing structure but does not follow a larger schema e.g. NoSQL, XML, JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional databases e.g. operational databases that use OLTP, are needed for storing relational structured data (relational schema).\n",
    " - They used to be enough for data storage\n",
    " - Then as data analytics took off, data warehouses were popularised for analysing structured data (OLAP)\n",
    " - In the age of big data, data lakes needed for storing data of all structures (flexible and scalable)\n",

    "DWH are optimised for analytics - OLAP\n",
    " - They contain data from multiple resources\n",
    " - Are usually read-only\n",

    "Normalisation is a technique that divides tables into smaller tables and connects them via relationships.\n",
    " - The goal of normalisation is to reduce data redundancy and increase data integrity by identifying repeating groups of data and creating new tables for them.\n",
    " - Several forms of normalisation exists (1NF, 2NF, 3NF ...).\n",
    " - Normalised DBs will look more complicated and you’d need lengthier more complex queries to retrieve data (more CPU requirements).\n",
    " - So why to use them? They save space (have more tables, but far less records) as there is not repeated information).\n",
    "\n",
    " - Therefore you have reduced data redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    " - More: data integrity through enforced data consistency (e.g. a record for ‘California’ won’t be found as ‘CA’ or ‘california’) this is called referential integrity\n",
    " - More: as records duplicates are reduced, it is safer to update, remove and insert data\n",
    " - More: as tables are smaller and organised by object, it’s easier to alter the database schema if needed (e.g. extend a table)\n",

    "  - else if primary key is a composite primary key (2 or more columns establish the key) then each non-key column must be dependent on all the keys\n",
