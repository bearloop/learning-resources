    " - Objective is to infer class labels\n",
    " - Divides the feature space into regions\n",
    "     - These are called decision regions and inside them all feature instances are assigned to one class label\n",
    "     - Decision boundaries: surface separating different decision regions\n",

    " - Hierarchy of nodes:\n",
    "     - Each node shows a question or a prediction\n",
    "     - Root node = no parent node, gives rise to two children\n",
    "     - Internal node = one parent node, gives rise to two children\n",
    "     - Leaf node = prediction is made here, no children nodes\n",
    "     - So the whole tree is made in such a way so that each leaf has a single predominant class label\n",
    " - To produce the purest leaf possible, the tree is using \"Information Gain\"\n",
    "     - The nodes are grown recursively = each internal node or leaf depends on the state of its predecessors\n",
    "     - To produce the purest leafs possible, at each node the tree asks a questions about one feature and a split point\n",
    "     - To select which feature and split point to ask about, the tree maximises the IG obtained after each split\n",
    "     - If the IG is null, the node is declared a leaf (or if you've reached the max depth specified)\n",
    "     - Unclear if the tree searches many several features and split points, calculating the IG for each and keeping the ones that have maximised it) ?\n",
    "     - Many criteria are used to calculate the information gain (impurity of a node) e.g. entropy or Gini index\n",
