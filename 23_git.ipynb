    "\n",
    "A version control system is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project. Many version control systems exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its strengths are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Version control isn't just for software: books, papers, parameter sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored and shared using something like Git."

    "If you don't use version control, a common workflow is to create different subdirectories to hold different versions of your project in different states, for example development and final. Of course, then you always end up with final-updated and final-updated-revised as well. The problem with this is that it becomes difficult to work out if you have the right version of each file in the right subdirectory, and you risk losing work.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons Git is popular is its support for creating branches, which allows you to have multiple versions of your work, and lets you track each version systematically.\n",
