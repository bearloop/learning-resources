    "#### What is version control?\n",
    "\n",
    "A version control system is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project. Many version control systems exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its strengths are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Version control isn't just for software: books, papers, parameter sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored and shared using something like Git."

    "A project's entire log can be overwhelming, so it's often useful to inspect only the changes to particular files or directories. You can do this using **git log path**, where path is the path to a specific file or directory.

    "3. For each of the files listed in the tree, there is a blob. This contains a compressed snapshot of the contents of the file when the commit happened (blob is short for binary large object, which is a SQL database term for \"may contain data of any kind\"). In the middle commit, report.md and draft.md were changed, so the blobs are shown next to that commit. data/northern.csv didn't change in that commit, so the tree links to the blob from the previous commit. Reusing blobs between commits help make common operations fast and minimizes storage space.\n",

This hash is normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string like 7c99a3ce607a14953f070f0f83b5d74c2296ef93, but most of the time, you only have to give Git the first 6 or 8 characters in order to identify the commit you mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashes are what enable Git to share data efficiently between repositories. If two files are the same, their hashes are guaranteed to be the same. Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have the same ancestors, their hashes will be the same as well.
