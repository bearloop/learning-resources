    "     - vals (immutable i.e. can't be reassigned once initalised)\n",
    "     - vars (mutable)\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/scala/java_equivalent_types.png\" style=\"height: 280px;\"/>\n",

    "Pros:\n",
    " - Data won't be changed inadvertently\n",
    " - Code is easier to reason about\n",
    " - Write fewer tests\n",
