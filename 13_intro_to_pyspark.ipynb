    "\n",
    "Spark is a platform for cluster computing. Spark lets you spread data and computations over clusters with multiple nodes (think of each node as a separate computer). Splitting up your data makes it easier to work with very large datasets because each node only works with a small amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As each node works on its own subset of the total data, it also carries out a part of the total calculations required, so that both data processing and computation are performed in parallel over the nodes in the cluster. It is a fact that parallel computation can make certain types of programming tasks much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with greater computing power comes greater complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding whether or not Spark is the best solution for your problem takes some experience, but you can consider questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Is my data too big to work with on a single machine?\n",
    " - Can my calculations be easily parallelized?\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, the cluster will be hosted on a remote machine that's connected to all other nodes. There will be one computer, called the master that manages splitting up the data and the computations. The master is connected to the rest of the computers in the cluster, which are called worker. The master sends the workers data and calculations to run, and they send their results back to the master.\n",

    "When you're just getting started with Spark it's simpler to just run a cluster locally.\n",

    "You can do this using the .createTempView() Spark DataFrame method, which takes as its only argument the name of the temporary table you'd like to register.

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, the following two expressions will produce the same output:\n",

    "> flights.filter(flights.air_time > 120).show()\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the first case, we pass a string to .filter(). In SQL, we would write this filtering task as SELECT * FROM flights WHERE air_time > 120. Spark's .filter() can accept any expression that could go in the WHEREclause of a SQL query (in this case, \"air_time > 120\"), as long as it is passed as a string. Notice that in this case, we do not reference the name of the table in the string -- as we wouldn't in the SQL request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, we actually pass a column of boolean values to .filter(). Remember that flights.air_time > 120 returns a column of boolean values that has True in place of those records in flights.air_time that are over 120, and False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use the .filter() method to find all the flights that flew over 1000 miles two ways:**\n",

These arguments can either be the column name as a string (one for each column) or a column object (using the df.colName syntax). When you pass a column object, you can perform operations like addition or subtraction on the column to change the data contained in it, much like inside .withColumn().\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between .select() and .withColumn() methods is that .select() returns only the columns you specify, while .withColumn() returns all the columns of the DataFrame in addition to the one you defined. It's often a good idea to drop columns you don't need at the beginning of an operation so that you're not dragging around extra data as you're wrangling. In this case, you would use .select() and not .withColumn().\n",
